# Game-Agent
final project in machine learning focusing on RL working with TensorFlow



Nowadays the technology is developing very fast and with this improvements, we shell to improve our lives with the help of machines.

 The demand for a machine that learns the environment that can replace the fighter soldier in the battle or the tired drivers on the road is become to be more necessary. 
Our project represents the ability of an agent to perform the best act in a dynamic basic environment.

our project based on  Reinforcement Learning algorithms (according to Wikipedia Reinforcement Learning is a technique of machine learning that based on the behaviorist psychology method, that calls to focus on trial and error between the agent to the environment. ) 

 The first step for all above is to make an agent that know how to handle his actions dynamically in the given environment.
 Our goal in this project is to make an agent that uses Reinforcement Learning algorithms by allowing humans to play a direct roll in training by providing demonstrations of correct behavior or by actively critiquing the model while the agent is learning.  The environment of the agent is dynamic with his own rules e.g it can be finite or infinite With certain limitations. Every action of the environment or the agent makes to change the environment that brings the agent to deal with a new situation and threats. for any action that the agent makes he gets a reward for better or for worse. the purpose of the agent is to maximize the reward to live as much as he can in his environment.

In this main algorithms that will represent in this project will be,

Q-table of finite states.
DNN - A Deep Neuronal network that learning the q-values
A3c - google actor-critic algorithm.
Human-input - that will actively critique the model while the agent is learning.
